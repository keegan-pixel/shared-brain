## Phase 0 — Foundation

**Shipped:** 2026-04-29
**Spec target:** Week 1–2

### What was built
- Next.js 16 scaffold (App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4)
- Drizzle schema for all 8 tables: `organizations`, `spaces`, `projects`,
  `items`, `wiki_pages`, `backlinks`, `activity_feed`, `vault_sync_log`
- `pgvector` extension auto-enabled by the migration runner
- Clerk auth wired through `src/proxy.ts`; sign-in / sign-up routes; ViaOps
  org auto-bootstraps on first authenticated request
- App shell: async sidebar (org → spaces → wiki), top bar (search, activity,
  Claude chat toggles, theme toggle, UserButton), dark mode via `next-themes`
- Org-scoped REST API for orgs / spaces / projects / items with Zod
  validation and a small `handle()` / `ApiError` / `parseJson()` helper
  layer
- Live on Vercel + Neon + Clerk (test keys for now)

### Divergences from spec
1. **Next 16, not 15.** `create-next-app@latest` shipped 16 by build day.
   App Router and TS strict are intact. See [[Decisions#ADR-003]].
2. **`proxy.ts`, not `middleware.ts`.** Next 16 deprecated the old name.
   See [[Decisions#ADR-002]].
3. **Drizzle, not Prisma.** Spec was tool-agnostic; chose Drizzle for TS-first
   ergonomics and serverless cold starts. See [[Decisions#ADR-004]].

### Friction encountered
- First Vercel deploy crashed at "Collecting page data" because the DB
  client threw on import when `DATABASE_URL` was missing during build.
  Fixed by lazy-init via Proxy. See [[Decisions#ADR-007]].
- pgvector wasn't visible in Neon's UI. Solved by scripting the
  `CREATE EXTENSION` in the migration runner. See [[Decisions#ADR-001]].

## Phase 2 — Vault Sync Agent

**Shipped:** 2026-04-30
**Spec target:** Week 3–4

### What was built

**Platform side (`src/`):**
- New `vault_sync_log` columns: `entity_type`, `entity_id` so the table doubles
  as a path → entity dispatch index for upserts. Migration `0001`.
- Six new HTTP endpoints under `/api/sync/*`, all Bearer-auth'd with the
  same `MCP_API_KEY`:
  - `POST /api/sync/wiki` — upsert wiki page (regenerates embedding)
  - `POST /api/sync/space` — find-or-create space by name
  - `POST /api/sync/project` — find-or-create project by (spaceId, name)
  - `POST /api/sync/item` — upsert item by (filePath, lineKey)
  - `POST /api/sync/activity` — append-only activity feed entry
  - `GET /api/sync/log` + `POST /api/sync/log` — list / record errors
- Sync paths added to the public route matcher in `src/proxy.ts` so Clerk
  doesn't try to validate them.
- All sync writes log to `activity_feed` with `actor_agent = "vault-sync"`.

**Agent side (`agent/`):**
- New subdirectory with its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and deps
  (chokidar, gray-matter, p-limit). Excluded from the Next root tsconfig.
- `src/config.ts` — vault root, include/ignore prefixes, concurrency cap.
- `src/parser.ts` — frontmatter parsing and `[ ]` / `[x]` task extraction.
- `src/mapper.ts` — vault-relative path → entity kind (per spec table):
  - `Knowledge/**/*.md` → wiki page
  - `Pipeline/*.md` → wiki page tagged `pipeline`
  - `Clients/[Name]/_Overview.md` → wiki + ensures space exists
  - `Clients/[Name]/_Tasks.md` → items (status from checkbox state)
  - `Clients/[Name]/Meetings/*.md`, `Meetings/**/*.md`,
    `Dashboard/Daily Notes/*.md` → activity log entries
  - `SimHouse.io/*.md` → wiki page
- `src/api.ts` — typed Bearer-auth fetch wrapper.
- `src/sync.ts` — file → entity sync logic, idempotent.
- `src/index.ts` — entrypoint with two modes:
  - `npm run sync:once` — full scan, exit (bootstrap)
  - `npm run sync:watch` — full scan + chokidar watcher (daemon)
  - `npm run sync:dry` — `--dry-run`, no API calls
- Concurrency capped at 5, errors per-file logged + `/api/sync/log` reports.
- `Projects/shared-brain/**` and `Archive/` are hard-ignored to prevent
  recursion and tomb-file noise.

### Divergences from spec
1. **Sync agent is server-to-server, not Clerk-authenticated.** Spec didn't
   specify; chose to share `MCP_API_KEY` so there's a single rotation point.
2. **launchd plist is a template in [[Runbook]], not committed as a file.**
   Auto-start persistence requires explicit user opt-in. Template provided
   for the user to install themselves.
3. **`Archive/` excluded by default.** Spec didn't mention it; obvious
   exclusion to avoid syncing tomb files.

### Verification
- Dry-run on full vault: 435 markdown files found, 402 mapped, 33 correctly
  ignored, zero errors.
- All sync routes typecheck and build cleanly. Vercel build passes.

### Friction encountered
- Next 16's typechecker tried to typecheck the agent subdir and failed on
  `.ts` extensions in imports. Fixed by adding `agent` to the root
  `tsconfig.json`'s `exclude` list. (Agent has its own tsconfig with
  `allowImportingTsExtensions`.)
- Harness blocked me from writing the launchd plist directly (correct call
  — auto-start service is persistence). Template moved to runbook for
  manual install.

## Phase 1 — MCP Server

**Shipped:** 2026-04-30
**Spec target:** Week 2–3

### What was built
- MCP server mounted at `/api/mcp` via `mcp-handler` + `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
  (Streamable HTTP transport)
- All **8 read tools** (per spec): `get_org`, `get_spaces`, `get_projects`,
  `get_items`, `get_wiki_pages`, `get_activity_feed`, `get_backlinks`, `search`
- **8 write tools** (spec listed 6, added 2 — see divergences):
  `create_space`, `create_project`, `create_item`, `update_item`,
  `move_item_status`, `create_wiki_page`, `update_wiki_page`, `add_backlink`
- Every write auto-logs an `activity_feed` entry (actor = `claude-mcp`)
- Bearer-token auth via `MCP_API_KEY` env var
- Optional OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` for `search` and wiki pages —
  falls back to ILIKE text match if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset
- Org context resolved by `MCP_USER_ID` (or first org as fallback)
- Updated README with Claude Desktop and Claude Code config snippets
- Interim UI pages: `/spaces/[id]` (project list) and `/projects/[id]` (items
  grouped into 6 swimlanes) — cheap precursor to the Phase 3 kanban

### Divergences from spec
1. **`create_space` and `create_project` added as MCP tools.** Spec listed
   only `create_item`, `create_wiki_page`, `add_backlink` as MCP writes. First
   time a real workflow tried to create a space via Claude Desktop, the gap
   was obvious. Added both — agents need to manage the full hierarchy without
   tabbing back to the browser. See [[Decisions#ADR-008]].
2. **Bearer token auth, not OAuth.** Spec didn't specify an auth mechanism;
   chose API-key for solo MVP simplicity. See [[Decisions#ADR-006]].
3. **mcp-handler wrapper used.** Thin Vercel-compatible wrapper around the
   raw SDK. See [[Decisions#ADR-005]].

### Verification
- Local `initialize` handshake against `/api/mcp` returns proper JSON-RPC
  response with `tools.listChanged: true`.
- Claude Desktop connected via `mcp-remote` stdio bridge — all 16 tools
  visible.
- Round-trip end-to-end: created `My Electric Home` (client space) via MCP
  from Claude Desktop with auto-logged activity feed entry.

### Friction encountered
- Claude Desktop config doesn't accept URL-based MCP servers directly;
  required `mcp-remote` bridge in the `claude_desktop_config.json`.
- mcp-remote args needed `Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}` env-var
  substitution because Claude Desktop's args parser sometimes mangles
  spaces in raw strings.

## Open issues / followups

- **Sidebar links to a 404 if the user creates a space whose page hasn't
  built yet** — fixed in Phase 1 by adding interim space/project pages.
- **Spec at `~/Documents/ViaOps/Knowledge/Frameworks/AI-Native PM Platform - MVP Spec.md`
  is referenced from the repo README via absolute path** — should be
  copy-synced into the repo by Phase 2's vault sync agent. For now, both
  vault and repo have copies that we update manually.
- **Single shared `MCP_API_KEY`** — fine for solo, but per-client keys are
  needed before sharing with other humans. Open question: do we issue keys
  via a `/settings/mcp` UI or via MCP-OAuth dynamic client registration?

## Process notes

- Each phase ends with: **(a)** updating this file's status snapshot table
  and adding a phase section, **(b)** appending any new entries to
  [[Decisions]], **(c)** marking the corresponding checkbox in
  [[AI-Native PM Platform - MVP Spec]] as complete.
- Commit messages narrate *why*, not just *what*. They're the most granular
  level of build history.
- Any decision that took more than 60 seconds to make becomes an ADR in
  [[Decisions]].
